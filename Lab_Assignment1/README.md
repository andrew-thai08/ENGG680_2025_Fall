The following tasks must be completed to keep the growing repository succinct and manageable: • Create a folder named Lab_Assignment1 • Upload your updated README.md file within the Lab_Assignment1 folder to include the name and UCID of each group member, as well as a short excerpt on what Assignment 1 is about. • Upload the Assignment1 Colab notebook within the newly created Lab_Assignment1 folder, as well as studentGrades_English.csv, studentGrades_Math.csv, and studentHomerooms.csv, data.xlsx. By placing the notebook and input files in the same folder, you ensure that the notebook can access the files. Additionally, output files generated by the notebook will be saved in the same folder. • These bookkeeping steps are expected for future assignments and will be explicitly evaluated, to keep the repository clean.

The purpose of Assignment 1 is to practice basic python fundamentals and to use Pandas, NumPy, and MatPlotLib to analyze and visualize data from studentGrades_English.csv, studentGrades_Math,csv, and studentHomerooms.csv.

Then using similar data analytic techniques and the linear least squares estimation, we will observe the relationship between the true and predicted values of the data in data.xlsx and predict: ...
